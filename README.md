## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me acquire more understanding of making custom navbars even without any CSS framwork like Bulma, etc. It also helped me understand the concept around making a webpage look more responsive as the screen size changes(though I still have alot of practice to do on this), I really appreciate the minds behind this project site(frontEndMentor).


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
